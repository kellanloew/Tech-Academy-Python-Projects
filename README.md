The fileMover folder contains the files for a desktop app I built that allows the user to find two directories, and upon a command, wil search for all txt files in one directory and move them to another.

The phonebook is a virtual phonebook in which the user can add peopel to teh phoenbook by entering names, phone, and email addresses, which the app saves to a database. The app also allows the user to edit existing entries. This is a code-along project with from the Tech Academy.
