The fileMover folder is the project folder for a desktop app I built that allows the user to find two directories, and upon a command, will search for all txt files in one directory and move them to another.

The phonebook is a gui app in which the user can add people to the phonebook by entering names, phone, and email addresses, which the app saves to a database. The app also allows the user to edit existing entries. This is a code-along project from the Tech Academy.

The hotel-products-website is a simple Django website tutorial that mimics a five-star hotel's menu for different meals and entrees.  In this code-along, we covered both front end and back end development.
